# capra-interface

This application can be used to control a Capra Hircus robot using Python.
The application consists of three layers:

- A Vue/Vite front-end
- A Python FastAPI back-end
- A Class containing methods for interfacing with a Capra Hircus robot.

## Requirements

This project has the following requirements:

- Python3
- Pip3
- NPM
- A Capra Hircus robot

## Connecting to the robot's wifi

To be able to control a Capra Hircus robot using this application, it is necessary to connect to the WiFi network that is generated by the robot.
Default credentials are:

- Network: HIRCUS-0027
- Password: CapraDefaultKey

**The application is only usable when connected to the WiFi network of the robot.**

After connecting with the WiFi you can press the _'Connect to Robot'_ button in the application:

## Installation - Back-end

To install the Python FastAPI back-end, run the following commands:

Install dependencies

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Start API server

```bash
uvicorn main:app
```

## Installation - Front-end

To install the Vue/Vite front-end, run the following commands:

Build front-end

```bash
cd capra-frontend
npm install
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

Start front-end server

```bash
cd capra-frontend
npm run dev
```

Alternatively it is possible to expose the front-end to the local network by using the following command:

```bash
npm run dev -- --host
```

## Capra Hircus path file

This application makes use of `.json` files structured as specified in the Capra Hircus official documentation. This files can be found in the `./data` folder.
Below is an example of a path file as specified by documentation:
